          Bond holders were wiped out because of foreclosure, not inflation…
          5%APR is common for mortgage because that is the rate in increase in
          money (debt) and currency. This makes your equity worth the borrowed
          money. That is the only case, yet that is 1/3 of debt, corporate and
          treasury being monetary-debit lessings, like a mortgage backed
          security, without direct collateral.
          <br />
          <br />
          Inflation does not help people in debt, for the amount they owe is the
          same, yet now they have higher ongoing expenses.
          <br />
          <br />
          Inflation helps companies corner the market, by depreciating past
          labor.

          <br />
          If they have no collateral that grows in value to match the borrowed
          money debasement, it doesn’t even help non-concurrently. We are really
          taking about mortgages, with tsy and corp being other 1/3 share, yet
          those are like mortgage backed securities with despondence from
          collateral.

            The price both of the great and small cattle which are fed on
            improved and cultivated land must be sufficient to pay the rent
            which the landlord, and the profit which the farmer has reason to
            expect from improved and cultivated land. If it is not, they will
            soon cease to feed them. Whatever part of this price, therefore, is
            not paid by the wool and the hide must be paid by the carcass. The
            less there is paid for the one, the more must be paid for the other.
            In what manner this price is to be divided upon the different parts
            of the beast is indifferent to the landlords and farmers, provided
            it is all paid to them.{space}
            <i>
              In an improved and cultivated country, therefore, their interest
              as landlords and farmers cannot be much affected by such
              regulations, though their interest as consumers may by the rise in
              the price of provisions.
            </i>{" "}
            ...According to this reasoning, therefore, this degradation in the
            price of wool is not likely, in an improved and cultivated country,
            to occasion any diminution in the annual produce of that commodity,
            except so far as, by raising the price of mutton, it may somewhat
            diminish the demand for, and consequently the production of, that
            particular species of butcher's meat. Its effect, however, even in
            this way, it is probable, is not very considerable.
            <i>
              But though its effect upon the quantity of the annual produce may
              not have been very considerable, its effect upon the quality, it
              may perhaps be thought, must necessarily have been very great. The
              degradation in the quality of English wool, if not below what it
              was in former times, yet below what it naturally would have been
              in the present state of improvement and cultivation, must have
              been, it may perhaps be supposed, very nearly in proportion to the
              degradation of price. As the quality depends upon the breed, upon
              the pasture, and upon the management and cleanliness of the sheep,
              during the whole progress of the growth of the fleece, the
              attention to these circumstances, it may naturally enough be
              imagined, can never be greater than in proportion to the
              recompense which the price of the fleece is likely to make for the
              labour and expense which that attention requires.

          Sure, but only pennywise, that margin on kickbacks (seller) and
          lending is ascertainable by PCE minus CPI, employer contributions by
          standardized guarantee schemes - such is nearly the same as
          monetary-debit lendings. Hard all else to delineate average price into
          premium for debt in general, unless we start talking GDP/p with less
          credit as income -1913 amidst 3%/yr+ population, too. Crowding out is
          a lie! I’m structuring alternative finance contracts by NAICS
          designation as “collateral” instead, and (cash/debt)*income reverse
          amortization, so we all paid what we would have without average price
          that we all share (bookie/market operation is ask-first, then bid).

          ascertainably-tortious upon the contractor.

          Are REITs a worthwhile investment in 2022 now that inflation and
          interest rates are rising?
          <br />
          Given my confidence in banning implausible use leases beyond 5
          storefronts and condominiums for ascertainable damages by removing
          imputation and capacity of renters to buy outright, and intent to do
          so deduced by said maximum, by unit, I would suggest not investing in
          REITs. However, as the federal reserve buys less bonds than necessary
          to suppress the $2t currency from asking for a higher coupon rate of
          $1.8t/yr debt spending, and $2.2t/yr tax, people rush to stocks
          generally, until the quantitative targeting resumes, of which I’m just
          as confident won’t happen, and instead we will reserve amortize all
          debts by (cash/debt)*income, moving to a NAICS max-royalty investing
          regime. Subsidies don't make more of something, they take input costs

            The reconciliation proposal and H.R. 3590 would maintain and put
            into effect a number of policies that might be difficult to sustain
            over a long period of time. Under current law, payment rates for
            physicians’ services in Medicare would be reduced by about 21
            percent in 2010 and then decline further in subsequent years; the
            proposal makes no changes to those provisions. At the same time, the
            legislation includes a number of provisions that would constrain
            payment rates for other providers of Medicare services. In
            particular, increases in payment rates for many providers would be
            held below the rate of inflation (in expectation of ongoing
            productivity improvements in the delivery of health care). The
            projected longer-term savings for the legislation also reflect an
            assumption that the Independent Payment Advisory Board established
            by H.R. 3590 would be fairly effective in reducing costs beyond the
            reductions that would be achieved by other aspects of the
            legislation.8

          Insurance makes money for you on par as a casino does, but its outlay
          and claims are donee invoking, meaning another customer can bid for
          what you gave to the end producer on an expiring premium basis. The
          logistical-reason why Obamacare price-controls was found to save money
          is merely because insurance deals in hours, invoices, prescriptions
          and prior authorizations, far from a broker permitting a collective
          bargain of concurrentable units, not siphoning free rider mutable
