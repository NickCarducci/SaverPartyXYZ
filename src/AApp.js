          Bloat prices for their input costs? Launder profits of their business

              Replying to @SaverParty Hello. We see you mentioned us, and wanted

              name is Nicholas Carducci, I had drafted a longer message but must
              have swiped it off and am now too tired to rewrite my whole
              argument. I would surely like to get your intentions with there
              being $70k/yr new cash per person and $3k/yr new promises on that
              cash, per person. You obviously do not intend to get the return
              you take from the lot. (1) Is that not colonialism and therefore
              slavery, promising other peoples’ money to yourselves and
              therefore counterfeit? Please understand all purchases will be
              reversed to their cash:debt level, now 44:1 and any furtherance to
              bail out lenders by currencyComponentOfM1 residual split as not in
              accordance with normal shares, and the disparage is violation of
              Amendment 14, 13 the Sherman Act and many common law regarding
              consent. (2) Where does the currencyComponentOfM1 go? Sun 11:46 AM

              <br />
              I will not be giving any future income back because the whole

              willing and ability without prisoner’s dilemma duress and under

              I will be bringing this class action suit to reverse purchases (or
              income) to their cash:debt levels and not allow any
              accrual-promise or actual dollar split to recoup for your bad bet
              that you must know there is not enough money, unrequited and

              Collateralized-credit is like a deposit, not an option where the
              price is locked in. That means repossession comes with a return of
              the down-payments to the supply chain you monopsonized Time-based
              business credit is also a method to launder money before demand is
